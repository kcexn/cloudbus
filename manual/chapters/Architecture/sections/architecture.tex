The architecture of a system running cloudbus is composed from the connection of many independently executing copies of two components: %
the cloudbus connector, and the cloudbus controller. The cloudbus connector facilitates piped stream processing and the cloudbus %
controller implements job control. The stages of an application may be simultaneously attached to arbitrarily many different connectors %
and controllers --- this means that controllers and connectors must never assume that they are the single-source of management for %
application execution.
