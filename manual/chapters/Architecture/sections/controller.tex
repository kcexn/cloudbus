\section{\AppName Controller}
The cloudbus controller facilitates the scheduling, routing, and control operations that must occur between each data processing stage. As %
request routing and application scheduling algorithms and approaches are iteratively always improving, the cloudbus controller %
is designed to expose application stream routing and job control signaling to third-party libraries and algorithms via carefully %
designed public interfaces and internal performance measurement data structures.

The cloudbus controller must expose the following public methods to both linked libraries and RPC mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Job STOP: taking as an argument a unique stage identifier and a non-empty list of node identifiers.
	\item Job START: taking as an argument a unique stage identifier and a non-empty list of node identifiers.
\end{itemize}

The cloudbus controller must expose the following performance measurement data structures to both linked libraries and RPC mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Job ARRIVAL TIME: taking as an argument a unique stage identifier --- returning the timestamp of the arrival time of the input %
	data to this stage.
	\item Job COMPLETION TIME: taking as an argument a unique stage identifer --- returning the timestamp of the arrival time of the %
	output data of this stage.
\end{itemize}
