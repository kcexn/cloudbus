\section{\AppName Segment}
The cloudbus segment facilitates the pipe ``\texttt{|}'' operation in a system running cloudbus. The segment must be transport layer %
agnostic so as to be as portable as possible across different systems as well as different types of distributed applications. %
All segments have two well-defined interfaces:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The inbound interface: provides the streaming interface on the left-hand side of the pipe operation.
	\item The outbound interface: provides the streaming interface on the right-hand side of the pipe operation.
\end{itemize}
While segments facilitate the streaming of data between the outputs of one data processing stage and the inputs of another, %
modern distributed data processing architectures will typically use many different application layer protocols for application %
layer routing and session control. As such, segments \emph{should} be application layer agnostic and facilitate %
translation between the application layer protocol on its inbound interface with its outbound interface.
