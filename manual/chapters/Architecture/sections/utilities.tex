\section{Other Components}
A system running cloudbus should also provide some additional utility components to facilitate access to the internal stream processing %
network. This may include, but is not limited to: border gateways for accepting inputs and returning outputs, queue managers for %
interfacing with third-party message queues, database managers for interfacing with third-party databases, API managers for interfacing %
with third-party API's (like Kubernetes), and process executors for launching data processing stages at the node level.
