Cloudbus is a distributed request router that combines application scheduling and messaging services in one framework. Cloudbus is designed %
to improve the resource usage efficiency of large-scale distributed applications that are deployed on time-multiplexed general purpose %
hardware --- a typical configuration for cloud data centers. Cloudbus achieves this by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dynamically exposing applications as networked services, with semantics similar to that of POSIX pipes.
	\item Binding application resource scheduling commands to networked control signals with semantics similar to that of POSIX job %
	control signals.
	\item Multiplexing application data streams with application resource scheduling controls.
	\item Exposing common network controls with an API that allows developers to implement queuing, routing, and scheduling %
	controls.
	\item Overlaying state-of-the-art queuing, routing, and scheduling algorithms on top of the basic Cloudbus infrastructure.
\end{itemize}
