	\begin{block}{Benefits}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Cloudbus enables application developers to delegate all of the I/O and other networked IPC concerns to a %
			lower layer in the OSI model so that developers no longer need to worry about implementing complex networked IPC for distributed %
			applications. 
		\end{itemize}
		Cloudbus aims to be a session-layer communication protocol and software suite that controls I/O pathway selection for distributed %
		and cloud-based applications.
