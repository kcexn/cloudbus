	\begin{block}{Benefits}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Cloudbus let developers of distributed applications delegate I/O and other networked IPC decisions to a lower layer in the %
			OSI model.
			\item Cloudbus provides dynamic I/O control for application data pathways, user ingress data, and user egress data.
			\item Cloudbus exposes networked services as if they were simple networked services, but implements a flexible application data %
			routing scheme at the session-layer (OSI layer 5).
		\end{itemize}
		Cloudbus aims to be a session-layer communication protocol and software suite that controls I/O pathway selection for distributed %
		and cloud-based applications.
