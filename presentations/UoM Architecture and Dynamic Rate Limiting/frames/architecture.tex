		\begin{block}{Benefits}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Cloudbus let developers of distributed applications delegate I/O and other networked IPC decisions to a lower layer.
				\item Cloudbus dynamically controls I/O for application, user ingress, and user egress data.
				\item Cloudbus implements a flexible data routing scheme at the session-layer to enable dynamic data pathway optimizations.
				\item Optimizing I/O in distributed and networked applications offers significant benefits to application performance and reliability.
			\end{itemize}

	\only<2>{
		\begin{block}{Design Philosophy}
			Cloudbus improves existing client-server applications by encapsulating application data at the session-layer and making transport %
			decisions for the application.
